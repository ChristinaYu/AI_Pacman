Project 1: Search in Pacman</br>
</br>
Implemented DFS, BFD, UCS, A star, corner problem, corner heuristics, food heuristics, suboptimal problem algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.</br>

</br>
Project 2: MlutiAgents Search</br>
</br>
Classic Pacman is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. Implemented multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.</br>
</br>
Project 3: Reinforcement Learning</br>
</br>
Implemented model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms like Q Learning, applied to the AIMA textbook's Gridworld, Pacman, and a simulated crawling robot.</br>
</br>
More to come!
